Solution WFP
the first step was to create a ER diagram, As you can see, it is a guide for developing the pseudo-code ( the tool that you used to create the diagram was https://www.draw.io/ )
the next step was the creation of the pseudocode and at the same time the development of the flow
( the tool that you used to create the diagram was https://code2flow.com/)
The first thing that is verified is that if the NFC of the device is active
Then read the tag and select the class
for the functionality and better performance  I create some classes and then call them when are necessary, according to the needs of the user of the device
it was valid that it fulfilled with:
Only elements can be added at the end of the list
Only a single event and its associated data can be written at a time
You can not edit existing items in the list and The list can be traversed in any direction
